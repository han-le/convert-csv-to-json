Office workers often send me data in Excel files. So I'm writing this tool to convert 
the data in csv file into an array and bring that array into my codes :)
This is a very convenient tool for me in my day to day work.

The csv file require 1 column without header (see the values.csv for reference)

How to install
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
